# Data Scientist

Hello there, and thank you for visiting my personal webpage! This space is a reflection of my commitment towards crafting a career in Artifical Intelligence with special focus on Natural Lanaguage Processing and Recommender Systems. It's not just a collection of my past projects and accolades; rather it's a timeline of my growth, my exploration, and my unwavering passion for technology. Whether you're a fellow student like me, a prospective employer, or simply someone intrigued by the endless possibilities of the digital world, you're in the right place. Take your time to peruse my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or simply share your thoughts. I firmly believe that every experience carries its own unique lessons. Some might involve the intracacies of turning machine learning models into production-ready giants (if you have experienced it, you know the stress that comes with it :)), while others, if not almost all of them may serve as valuable building blocks for enhancing life skills and personal development.

### Similar Cases Recommendation Using Legal Knowledge Graphs
[View Workshop Demo Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04771)

A legal knowledge graph constructed from court cases, judgments,
laws and other legal documents can enable a number of applications
like question answering, document similarity, and search. While
the use of knowledge graphs for distant supervision in NLP tasks
is well researched, using knowledge graphs for downstream graph
tasks like node similarity presents challenges in selecting node
types and their features. In this demo, we describe our solution
for predicting similar nodes in a case graph derived from our legal
knowledge graph.

#### Contributions
- Derived the ontology for legal knowledge graph by a combination of manual process and topic modeling.
- Developed link prediction RGCN model using domain-specific features from 2200+ IPR documents.
- Achieved 5% improvement in AUC over pre-trained STANZA and spaCy entity recognition models.
- Our research received recognition at the KGKDD-2021 conference held in Singapore and has recently been accepted into the proceedings at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sail-2023/call-for-papers?authuser=0">3rd Symposium for AI and Law</a>, held at IIIT-Hyderabad.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
